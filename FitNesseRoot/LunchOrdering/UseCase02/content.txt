!1 User orders lunch


!2 Main Scenario

1 User logs in
2 System informs user of the current balance and shows available products
3 User selects lunch by adding available products to order
4 System verifies the remaining balance and informs user of balance and order

  repeat 3-4  till order complete

5 User confirms choice
6 System validates and updates balance, registers order
7 System confirms order and wishes the User a nice day

 
!2 Alternatives

2a Remaining balance is too low to order any product
- 2a1 System informs user that nu order is possible 
- 2a2 [[User adds money to Balance][UseCase01]]

2b Remaining balance is too low to offer all products
- 2b1 The System shows the products but makes them unavailable

6a User tries to cheat and confirms multiple orders of which the sum exceeds the balance.
!*> rationale
The user opens several sessions and builds several orders for which the total exceeds the balance. It depends strongly on the implementation but is a risk worth checking for. It serves to verify the validation is against the persistent record f the balance, not some cached value in a session or conversation.
*!
6a1 Validation of remaining balance fails
6a2 System informs user the remaining balance is insufficient.
